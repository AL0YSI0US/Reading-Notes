# [Group Name] 
## Team Agreement

Communication plan:

### How will your group communicate with each other?

Slack / github project board / remo

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, 
and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Open coms about project ideas through slack
Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety? Rest breaks [using timers] drinking water / checking in with folx prior to diving into coding…”dropping in”.

### Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict?  What will your process be to resolve it?

Consider the realities that we may run into hiccups along the way that change our desired timelines, finding out who may be the best suited to problem solve based on the issues subject matter may be a good way not to get hung up on something. Asking for help!!!

Work plan: GitHub Project Board? []() come back and put a link
How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?  
GitHub Project Board = Capture TODO and by Who / Completed..in progress / Idea board  
Slack = Document trigger a repository action PRs/ Merging / conflicts

In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used? Break out the project / use git project board to track work

Git process: What lives on GitHub? What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Designate a single person for pull requests, merges and updating the project board and we can cycle each day...This way only one person is doing each task and we can track better. - communication [project board / slack group]
Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times (outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc.

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team. During that meeting the group should review the Team Agreement guidelines and decide on a course of action for items such as communication and conflict resolution. Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
Submitting Your Work
This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit, please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.
Review the team agreement, and as a group decide on which areas each group member should be aware of and which areas are strengths. Put a plan of action together for mitigating any communication issues amongst the team. Submit this agreement in the text field in Canvas, or a link to a Google doc.
This step must be completed and approved before any future approvals will be given. (Example: Your project pitches will not be approved until you have this step completed.)
