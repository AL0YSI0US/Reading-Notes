> HTML Example

|**Term**|**Context**| 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| HTML      | **Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as *Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)* and scripting languages such as *JavaScript.* Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.  With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags directly introduce content into the page. Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as *JavaScript*, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of *CSS* defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the *CSS* standards, has encouraged the use of *CSS* over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.|
| Markup   | When creating a web page, you add ***tags*** (known as **Markup**) to the contentsof the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the pages. | 
| Structural Markup|the elements you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs |
| Semantic Markup| which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms and so on |
| WireFrame      | A wire-frame model, also **wireframe** model, is a visual representation of a three-dimensional (3D) physical object used in 3D computer graphics. It is created by specifying each edge of the physical object where two mathematically continuous smooth surfaces meet, or by connecting an object's constituent vertices using (straight) lines or curves. The object is projected into screen space and rendered by drawing lines at the location of each edge. The term "wire frame" comes from designers using metal wire to represent the three-dimensional shape of solid objects. 3D wire frame computer models allow for the construction and manipulation of solids and solid surfaces. 3D solid modeling efficiently draws higher quality representations of solids than conventional line drawing. |
| Personas   | -----------        |
| Meta      | The **Meta** element lives inside the ***head*** element and contains information about the web page. It is not visible to users but fulfuls a number of pyrposes such as telling search engines wbout your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire)|
| Content   | -----------        |
| Element | The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets. These are called HTML **elements** Elements are usually made up of two ***tags***: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has am extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags. ***the term "tag" and "element" are often used interchangebly*** |
| Tag      | **Tags** act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. ***the term "tag" and "element" are often used interchangebly***|
| Attribute   | **Attributes** tell us more about elements. Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a ***name*** and a ***value***, seperated by an equals sign.|
| Structure   | HTML uses elements to describe the **structure** of the page. **html** / **body** / **h1** / **p** / **h2** / **p** / **h2** / **p** / **/body** / **/html** |
| Presentation | ----------- |
| Render | **Rendering** or ***image synthesis*** is the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a computer program. The resulting image is referred to as the render. Multiple models can be defined in a scene file containing objects in a strictly defined language or data structure. The scene file contains geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information describing the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file. The term "rendering" is analogous to the concept of an artist's impression of a scene. The term "rendering" is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing program to produce the final video output. |
