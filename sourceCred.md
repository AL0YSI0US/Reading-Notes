## Meetup One:

[SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) is a community in which most contributors are remote and work asynchronously, allowing anyone to contribute no matter their location and availability. We hold regularly scheduled calls, open to everyone, to cultivate a culture of joyful collaboration and meaningful connection between members. These calls have different specific purposes (and expectations), and are held on the SourceCred Discord server using the voice and video channels.

> They meet: Weekly, Thursday at 11am Pacific Time on the SourceCred Discord.

SourceCred (in the most basic sense) is a technology that makes the labor of individuals more visible and rewardable as they work together in a project or community. The goal of SourceCred is to use this technology to make rewarding labor as nuanced as human contribution often is.

## Who I met with:

### **Bex** [She/Her] *Followup Scheduled*

**Her Skills:**

+ Leadership
+ emotional labor
+ learning new skills (currently learning to use Github)
+ marketing/social media strategy

How she contributes to SourceCred:

+ Community Cultivation
+ Business & Strategy
+ **Documentation**
+ Design

> When Bex first joined SourceCred, being quite new to tech her primary input was making SourceCred more accessible to non-tech people. That role has grown into writing and reviewing documentation, creating the onboarding process, and community cultivation overall.

### How can I contribute with Bex?

After our followup next week I should have a lead on some documentation projects I can assist with. I like the idea of having my hand help so to speak when I am learnihng the ropes at something. Learning to ask for help has been a journey over the past two years but it's starting to pay off. As in emotionally I can ask, and can recieve help to some degree without completely tearing myself apart in the process [low self worth].

## Meetup two...

Im curious about trying my hand at Documentation. I realized recently I have a lot of experience with this but did not have the language for translating that experience into the tech industry. I am also working with some folx on a program called Swipe. They are based out of Russia and I am translating thier user guides (located on the applications website,*95% of it is written in Russian*) from Russian to English using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) and Markdown. So I guess I am sort of communicating with some other folx too working with thier repository.

## About Swipe:

Swipe is a code generation tool that automates the creation of repetitively used code. Configuration parameters are presented in Swipe as parameters of the Golang function, using explicit initialization instead of global variables or reflections.

Github-fu....I saw this at the bottom of thier rpositoty....

#### Documentation

[User guide](http://swipeio.dev/) PS. at the moment only in Russian

The seed was planted so I translated a page, missed the syntax on the first go-arount but have a solid idea of what they could use help with and know that overall it will benefit me too with practicing workflow, collaboration, user story from the visual learning perspective and github etc...
