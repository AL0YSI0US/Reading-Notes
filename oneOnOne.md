### 1. Bex (she/her)

### Organization: Source Cred

**I met Bex by attending a weekly community call for Source Cred.** 

> What I learned about the worke she does:

Bex does a lot of documentation at Source Cred and does not have much tech experience. 

SourceCred uses an algorithm to determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall. 

When a contribution is made to a project, SourceCredâ€™s purpose is to "see" that contribution and assign it an amount of 

"Cred" based on how much value it brought to the project as a whole. Each community implimenting this 

algorithm gets to determine the weight of specific contributions. 

Cred can then be turned into Grain.

Grain is a project-specific digital currency that is minted and distributed to contributors who have Cred in that project. 

Grain is tied to your Cred; as you earn Cred, you also earn Grain. Unlike Cred, 

Grain is a form of currency and is meant to be transferable both inside and outside of the project.

### How I can Help

I am already attending weekly meetings and contributing to projects and helping to plug away at the 

backlog of operational items to address. I'm not working directly with Bex, but the work I do supports 

her work overall. This algorithm is being backed by a generous supporter and we are all being paid to create it/ debug it in the process.
