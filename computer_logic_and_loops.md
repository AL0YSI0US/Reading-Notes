Loop / While / For / Condition / Increment / Decrement

## Loop counters

|  **Initialization** |  **Condition**  | **Update**  |
|  :----: |  :----:  | :----:  |
|  create a variable and set it to **0**. This variable is commonly called **i**, and it acts as the counter | | the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified counter.  | Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter.  |

|  **var i = 0;** |   **i > 10;**   | **i++**  |

|  the variable is only created the first time the loop is run. variable (i) also referred to as *index* |  the value of **i** was initially set to **0**, so in this case the loopwill run 10 times before stopping.  | one is added to the counter using the (++) operator.  |

# Computer Logic and Loops

| ***Term*** | Context | 
|  :----: |  ----  |   
|  **Loop**  | loops check a condition. If it returns **true**, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns **true**, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns **false**. *there are three common types of loops:* **for : while : do while**  | 
|  **for**  | If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a **for** loop. (it is the most common loop.) In a **for** loop,the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run. |
|  **while**  | If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use **while** loop. Here the condition can be something other than a computer,and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is **true**. |
|  **do while**  | the **do...while** loop is very similar to the ***while*** loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to **false**. |
|  **Loop Counters**  | a **for** loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times. ***The condtion is made up of three statements:*** **initialization : condtion : update** |
|  **Condition**  | the loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number.  |

|  **Decrement**  | ooo  |
