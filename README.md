# **The Growth Mindset** 

 Is resilient to change.

When it finishes a project,
it isn't actually complete
until it has sourced feedback.

It Listens, takes notes, asks questions and understands that the real ***magic*** happens
when you actively enlist the support of others.

Most importantly...

A Growth Mindset knows *"mistakes"* are simply
a nessesary part of the creative process.
## **MAINTAIN YOUR MINDSET**
- [x] Learn something new everyday
- [x] Mentor someone older than yourself
- [x] Be mentored by someone younger than you
- [x] Be like Banksy: Remember to rest when you are tired, not quit.

sun kisses their only visible eye, they are happy.
