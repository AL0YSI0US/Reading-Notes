# **The Growth Mindset...**

Is resilient to change.

When it finishes a project,
it isn't actually complete
until it has sourced feedback.

It listens, takes notes, asks questions and understands that the real ***magic*** happens

when you actively enlist the support of others.

**Most importantly,**

A Growth Mindset knows *"mistakes"* are simply
a nessesary part of the creative process.
## **NOURISHING THE MINDSET**
- [x] **Learn** something new everyday
- [x] Mentor someone **older** than yourself
- [x] Be mentored by someone **younger** than you
- [x] Be like Banksy: Remember to **rest** when you are tired, not quit.

sun kisses their only visible eye, they are happy.
