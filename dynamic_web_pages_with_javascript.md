[In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)

Use **if** to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use **else** to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use **else if** to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use **switch to** specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

## The if Statement (True)

Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is **true.**

**Syntax**

if (condition) {

  //  *block of code to be executed if the condition is true*

}

## The else Statement (False)

Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is **false.**

**Syntax**

if (condition) {

  //  *block of code to be executed if the condition is true*

} else {

  //  *block of code to be executed if the condition is false*

}

## The else if Statement (1st condition is false)

Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

**Syntax**

if (condition1) {

  //  *block of code to be executed if condition1 is true*

} else if (condition2) {

  //  *block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true*

} else {

  //  *block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false*

}

## The JavaScript Switch Statement

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

**Syntax**

switch(expression) {

  case x:

    // *code block*

    break;

  case y:

    // *code block*

    break;

  default:

    // *code block*

}

**This is how it works:**

+ The switch expression is evaluated once.
+ The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
+ If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
+ If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

## OPERATORS

Java divides the **operators** into the following groups:

+ Arithmetic operators
+ Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
+ Logical operators
+ Bitwise operators

## Java Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

## Java Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the **assignment** operator (=) to assign the value **10** to a variable called **x**:

**Example**

int x = 10;

The **addition assignment** operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

**Example**

int x = 10;

x += 5;
## Java Comparison Operators

## Java Logical Operators

## Java Bitwise Operators
