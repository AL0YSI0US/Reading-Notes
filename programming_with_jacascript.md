# Programming with JavaScript

## Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable name:

1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or and underscore (_). It must **not** start with a number.
2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). *Note that you must not use a dash (-) os a period (.) in a variable name.*
3. you cannot use ***keywords** or **reserved** words. *Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something.* [Keywords/Reserved Words](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp)
4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but its bad practice to create the same name using different cases.
5. Use a name that describes the types of information that the variable stores. For example firstName might be used to store a persons first name, lastName, age etc.
6. camelCaseYourVariableName *or* you_can_use_an_underscore **however; you cannot use** (-) a dash.

## Output to the console

console.log("ALOYSIOUS TAKES REDONK READING NOTES!");


| ***Term*** | Context |
| :-: | - |
| **Array** | an array is a special type of variable. It doesnt just store one value; it stores a list of values.*values and arrays are seperated by commas* **index numbers for numbering an array start at 0 not 1** |
| **Script** | is a series of instructions that a computer fan follow to achieve a goal. |
| **Expression** | an**expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two kinds: *expressions that assign a value to a variable* ( var color = 'beige'; the value of color is now beige) *and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value* ( var = area 3 * 2; the value of area is now 6 ) |
| **Operator** | expressions rely on**operators**; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. |
| **Programmatic problem solving** | computers follow a series of instructions one after another:**programatically** |
| **Function** | Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. |
| **Objects** | Programmers use objects to create models of the world using data. Objects are mae up of*properties and methods.* |
| **Built-in Objects** | The browser comes with a set of objects that act liek a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. |
| **Declaration** | before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name.***Programmers say that you*** *declare* ***a variabe*** |
| **Tata types** | Numeric: 0.75 , String: 'Hi Aloysious!', Boolean: true |
| **Call** | The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object.*Having declared the* ***function***, *you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as ***calling*** *the function.* |
| **Parameters** | Function**parameters** are the **names** listed in the function definition. |
| **Arguments** | Function**arguments** are the real **values** passed to (and received by) the function. |
| **Return value** | The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.**Tip:** *Use the void keyword to specify that a method should not have a return value* [TIP](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_keyword_return.asp) |
| **Refactoring** | code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality. Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code's maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Another potential goal for refactoring is improved performance; software engineers face an ongoing challenge to write programs that perform faster or use less memory. |
| ***this*** | the keyword***this*** is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what ***this*** means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. |
